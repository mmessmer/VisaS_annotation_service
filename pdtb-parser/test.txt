Unlike spoken language which consists of acoustic sound patterns, sign language uses  manual communication to convey meaning. This essay examines main components of sign  language grammar and features of the language that are related to the spatial medium.  Furthermore, it points out similarities between spoken languages and signed languages and  discusses why spoken languages are more commonly used.  Throughout this essay I refer to Penny Boyes Braem’s ideas which she states in the first and  third chapter of her book.  
Sign language includes several means of expression which are divided into two main  categories. Manual means include the signer’s hands and arms as well as the four  parameters of sign articulation: hand location (that is place of articulation), hand movement,  handshape and hand orientation. Non-manual markers such as the signer’s mouth and head  or facial expressions can express feelings and are of fundamental importance when it comes  to grammar. (Boyes Braem 1990, p. 18)  
While words consist of consonants and vowels; signs are expressed through hands. The  meaning of a sign can be changed by modifying one of the manual components. This  resembles spoken language as a change of a single phoneme changes a word’s or even an  utterance’s meaning. Minimal pairs in both spoken and signed language are created when  the structure of two words differs in only one aspect. (Boyes Braem 1990, p. 24)  
A condition of linguistic codes is that they consist of a limited number of elements. Even  though humans can produce many sounds, spoken languages only refer to a limited number.  The same applies to the use of gestures in signed languages.  
Both languages follow certain linguistic rules and have restrictions when combining language  components. In spoken language, restrictions on possible combinations of sounds are called  ‘phonotactic constraints’.
This dummy sentence precedes the connectives. On the one hand there is this subclause, on the other hand there is this one. Firstly, this sentence is mentioned. Secondly, there is this sentence which is completely nonsensical. Finally, this sentence is not really important as well. Some more dummy text is added at the end.
